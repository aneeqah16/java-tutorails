package Encapsulation;
//what is encapsulation
//wrapping up the implementation of the data and the members in the class
// hides up all the data and the functions in the single entity or unit
// that can be protected form the outside world


// What is Abstraction?
//Abstraction on the other hand means that hiding the unnecessary information/ details
// and only showing valuable information
// Question :  you need to know the mechanics of the car in order to run the car
//  Answer : NO
// Example:
// if I want to print something , we use println function,
// how it's doing it internally we don't care
//DO WE? ==> no
//that's why  they are known as abstract datatypes as well
// abstract datatypes means that you are able to access the
// and modify this using some methods like get and set




// Question: how's encapsulation different from abstraction?
// Answer:
// Abstraction means hiding the unnecessary data but only showing the
// essential information
//eg
// start the car , get  the element, print the element etc

// Abstraction is solving the design level issue and the
// Encapsulation is solving the implementation issue

// Abstraction is the process of gaining information and
// encapsulation is the process of containing the information

// Difference between data hiding and encapsulation
// data hiding deals with the data security along with hiding the complexity and
// encapsulation focuses on hiding the complexity of the system
//we can say that encapsulation is the part of the data hiding
// data hiding is achieved via encapsulation and encapsulation is the subprocess of the data hiding
